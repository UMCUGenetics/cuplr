\description{
A wrapper function around NNLM::nnmf() to extract signatures from a numeric matrix
(where columns are features and rows are samples).

The function determines the optimum NMF rank by first setting a portion of values
(`impute.prop`) in the input matrix to NA, which triggers value imputation from NNLM::nnmf(). A
mean squared error (MSE) between the original and imputed values is determined. The above
procedure is repeated several times (`repeats`), after which median MSE values are calculated.
The optimum rank is in theory the rank at which MSE is minimum, however in practice, this is
the rank before which MSE increases by a certain threshold (`max.rel.log.mse.increase`).
