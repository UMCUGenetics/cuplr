}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the training features and response column.}

\item{folds}{Alternative input to df. A list with the structure: `l[[1]][c('train','test')]`
where 'train' and 'test' are dataframes which features and a response column. This is the output
from `createCvTrainTestSets()`}

\item{train.func}{A training function.}

\item{train.func.args}{Arguments (as a list) that can be passed to the training function.}

\item{colname.response}{The column name of the response variable (i.e. training labels).}

\item{k}{Number of cross validation folds.}

\item{seed}{Random seed as in integer.}

\item{multi.core}{Use multiple cores?}

\item{verbose}{Show progress messages?}
}
\value{
A list containing for each CV fold, the output of the training function
}
