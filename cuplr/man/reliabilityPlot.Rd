the prediction probabilities from each random forest}

\item{n.bins}{Number of (equidistant bins)}

\item{bootstrap.iters}{Number of bootstrap iterations to calculate error bars (standard deviation)}

\item{bootstrap.prop}{Proportion of all samples to sample from for boostrapping}

\item{seed}{Bootstrap seed}

\item{show.labels}{Show labels at each point}

\item{min.samples.per.bin}{Points with fewer samples than this will no be considered for the
overlaid (filtered) reliability curve}

\item{verbose}{Show progress messages?}
}
\value{
A ggplot object

\description{
Bin probabilities and calculate the proportion of positive class samples per bin.
The proportion of positive class samples (y-values) will be plotted against the midpoint of each
probability bin (x-values), and a curve will connect the points. A 'filtered' curve is also shown
where points supported by too few samples (<`min.samples.per.bin`) will be ignored for plotting
this curve.
